## Source Directory - "src"

All code directly used by the project. For Visual Studio projects, a 
separate Solution folder should NOT be used. Solution file(s) live in the src 
folder, with sub-folders for each project. Multiple Solution files are allowed 
but it is encouraged that separate applications live in their own repository. 
Unit test projects should also be kept here, although tests that rely on the 
fully-built (and deployed) application should be in tests as they are not 
actually part of the application.
